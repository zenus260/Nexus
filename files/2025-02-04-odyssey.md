  ## Executive Summary


  The purpose of this project was to identify and understand the needs and
  travel habits of Gen Z in South Africa. The end goal was to use these insights
  to design a product that would not only satisfy their needs, but also provide
  an exceptional experience. This project was continuously developed using a
  range of UX methodologies to ensure that the product fulfils all of its
  criteria in a holistic manner. These methodologies include but are not limited
  to: user interviews, design strategy, customer and user journeys, wireframes,
  and user testing.


  The resulting app aims to streamline the process of organising and booking a
  holiday in a way that is intuitive to its target audience. It achieves this
  primarily through the use of travel "playlists". This playlist functionality
  allows users to:


  *   Easily curate and compare holidays in a personalised list.
      
  *   Group holidays according to custom categories.
      
  *   Share travel plans with other individuals.
      
  *   Plan holidays collaboratively with family and friends.
      
  *   Leave personal notes for later referral by the user or other travelmates.
